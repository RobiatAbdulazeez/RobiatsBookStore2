# RobiatsBookStore2

 In this project, I utilized the robust .NET Core 5 framework to create a dynamic web application. The project leverages the ASP.NET Core Web App template, implementing individual user account authentication that automatically generates a structured data folder for secure 
 information storage. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and the Razor Runtime Compiler ensures seamless content loading upon webpage refresh, enhancing user interaction. To improve the user interface, a Bootswatch theme was integrated, 
 providing an appealing design. Additionally, I introduced a content management dropdown menu, enhancing the website's functionality. During development, debugging was facilitated through the use of breakpoints. Furthermore, the project was expanded with the addition of
 three new projects (RobiatBooks.DataAccess, RobiatBooks.Models, and RobiatBooks.Utility), each serving specific functions. Existing folders, such as data and view, were copied into these new projects.
 To optimize data handling, essential packages like Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational, and Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer were installed. These measures collectively contribute to the project's robustness and performance.
